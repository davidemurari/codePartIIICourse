## Repository for the Part III Graduate Course "Geometric Numerical Analysis and Deep Learning (2024-25)"

You can find the code for the topics covered in the lectures divided into two folders:
- Neural Networks
- Numerical Methods

In Neural Networks you can also find the code to generate the gif on the linear separation of points with dynamical systems
